The support forum for the users on Google Groups : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poker-director (not in use anymore).

The app has not been updated since a long time so you will probably have some problem with the lastest Android version.

Since I don't have the time to update the app anymore, I have open sourced Poker Director. If you have the time and will to continue to improve the app, please leave a message !
